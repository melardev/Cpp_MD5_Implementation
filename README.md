# Introduction
MD5 implementation I wrote in C++ many years ago, this was a really old code I have written.
This code is not meant to be used in real world applications obviously, but only for learning, it is easy to read and
not very professional code. I upload it as my <em>souvenir</em> and also for sharing code with beginners that may
want to learn cryptography and find very difficult to read professional code.
